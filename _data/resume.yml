      As part of the project, an existing web platform was extended with a component for in-house document and file management to reduce paperwork and administrative friction for company management.

    summary: >
      As a student assistant and software developer at the Coordination Office for Data Processing in Administration at the State Universities of Applied Sciences in Bavaria (Germany), I was given the task to develope a internally used web platform for data management and administration.

      The project involved tasks such as requirement analysis, data modeling, UI concept, web application development with C# and JavaScript, and use of GUI frameworks such as ASP.NET Core MVC and Bootstrap 4.

      I mapped the data model using Entity Framework Core and Microsoft SQL Server and implemented continuous test-driven development using the MSTest unit testing framework.

      Throughout the project, I worked closely with the responsible domain expert and proved that I could integrate complex changes through clean refactoring in existing source code.
